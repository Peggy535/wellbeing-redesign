    <p class="grid cols-span-1 row-span-1 text-md leading-relaxed m-1 p-1"> Before qualifying as a Curative hypnotherapist & CBT practitioner, and now specialising in Anxiety and Stress Therapy. 
      I was a very successful health & fitness professional. My previous career spanned across a number of decades. Many of my job roles opened up huge opportunities to 
      work abroad and took me to some amazing countries where I had the privilege of spending time with many diverse groups of people. 
    </p>
    <p class="grid cols-span-1 row-span-1 text-md leading-relaxed m-1 p-1"> Then, three years ago I decided to close that chapter of my life and change course completely and Justine Hodgson Hypnotherapy was born.
    </p>
    <p class="grid cols-span-1 row-span-1 text-md leading-relaxed m-1 p-1"> My practice is growing, and growing up alongside me as I continue to master my craft, maturing, developing 
      and moulding into something very different from just hypnotherapy. Through my clinical hours of practice and over the course of time I've recognised this common 
      thread I seem to have naturally propagated towards that I now have a huge desire to focus on. 
    </p>
  </div>
      <p class="text-md leading-relaxed m-1 p-1">
        At the root cause of most of my clients' conditions the common thread comes from some form of anxiety and stress usually causing chaos with many sections 
        of their lives and even causing ill health. So putting all of my skill set together from past and present I am now offering 'Relaxation Therapy' a combination 
        of relaxation techniques catered for the individual and their own needs and requirements.
