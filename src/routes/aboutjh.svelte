        Covid journey, in fact the sympathetic nervous system becomes very sensitive after the initial covid infection for many who go onto to develop Long Covid, so moving into the parasympathetic system 
        and staying there as often and for long periods plays a vital role in recovery and managing of the chronic symptoms.

      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text2xl leading-relaxed sm:leading-relaxed md:leading-relaxed lg:leading-loose m-1 p-1 "> AFTER qualifying as a Curative hypnotherapist & CBT practitioner, and now 
        specialising in Anxiety and Stress Management. I was a very successful health & fitness professional. My previous career spanned across a number of decades. Many of my job roles opened up huge 
        opportunities to work abroad and took me to some amazing countries where I had the privilege of spending time with many diverse groups of people. 
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text2xl leading-relaxed sm:leading-relaxed md:leading-relaxed lg:leading-loose m-1 p-1"> THEN, three years ago I decided to close that chapter of my life 
        and change course completely and Justine Hodgson Hypnotherapy was born.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg sm:text-xl md:text2xl leading-relaxed sm:leading-relaxed md:leading-relaxed lg:leading-loose m-1 p-1"> MY PRACTICE is growing, and growing up alongside me as I continue to master 
        my craft, maturing and developing and moulding into something very different from just hypnotherapy. Through my clinical hours of practice and over the course of time I’ve recognised this common 
        thread I seem to have naturally propagated towards that I now have a huge desire to focus on. At the root cause of most of my clients' conditions the common thread comes from some form of anxiety 
        and stress usually causing chaos with many sections of their lives and even causing ill health. So putting all of my skill set together from past and present I am now offering ‘Relaxation Therapy’ 
        a combination of relaxation techniques catered for the individual and their own needs and requirements.
