      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">By now hopefully, you’ve pressed the play button on both my welcome and about me recordings and I’ve saved you valuable time on reading a 
        page full of words without much connection. As a hypnotherapist, it’s important you get a feel for my voice and personality if we are going to do some work together. 
        I’m also a strong believer in being as real on paper as I am in person, hopefully this all resonates and feels authentic for every visitor to my site.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">At this stage you would have heard my story and know, just as so many before me and many to follow, I’ve had my own path to travel and it’s not always been straight 
        forward but it has led me to where I am today and it continues to get better and convince me that, miracles actually do happen, every single day.</p>

      Having personally experienced such things as anxiety, trauma and chronic fatigue syndrome, and having recovered through the same therapies I offer today, 
      allows me to truly understand other's issue's, and how best to treat them.

      <p class="text-lg">I’m that guide. My desire today and every day hereon, is to make people feel less broken, so they can experience more joy and happiness and less stress in their lives. 
        This in turn can only benefit those around them, and there we have it, a beautiful ripple effect begins and reaches far and wide, as far as the imagination can take you!</p>
