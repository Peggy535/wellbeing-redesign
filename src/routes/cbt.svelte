        CBT is a therapy that focuses on the particular ways in which an individual thinks, behaves and acts, in the attempt to deal successfully with their behavioural, 
        emotional and social problems and issues.

        between psychotherapy and behavioural therapy is that psychotherapy tends to emphasise the importance of the personal meaning placed upon things and how the majority 
        of thinking patterns begin in childhood. Behavioural therapy relates to everything the person does. How they act with other people, when they are alone. How they avoid certain aspects 
        of life and how they engage and interact with the world around them. How active or inactive towards being involved in participating in life on a healthy level.

        that ‘CBT’ has over other therapies is that clients undergoing ‘CBT’ treatment are actually learning the educational aspects of the therapy, which is then empowering them to become 
        their own personal therapist and to be more aware of the circumstances, situations, behaviours and people that could cause them to lapse and therefore to be able to avoid these aspects in their lives.
